# ü§ñ UR3e + Robotiq 2F-140 + RealSense Integration on ROS 2 Humble

This repository contains a **collection of ROS 2 Humble scripts and launch setups** to control a **UR3e robotic arm**, a **Robotiq 2F-140 gripper**, and a **RealSense camera**, intended for use with real hardware.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repository is not yet a fully structured ROS 2 package ‚Äî it is a collection of nodes, scripts, and configuration files meant for **integration and experimentation**.

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

This setup builds on the following open-source projects:

- **[IFRA-Cranfield ROS 2 Robotiq Gripper Driver](https://github.com/IFRA-Cranfield/IFRA_LinkAttacher)**  
  Used to interface with the Robotiq 2F-140 gripper over Modbus TCP.

- **[Universal Robots ROS 2 Driver (UR Driver)](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Driver)**  
  Official driver for controlling UR3e (and other UR series) robots using ROS 2.

- **[RealSense ROS 2 Wrapper (Intel)](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros)**  
  (Optional) For integrating Intel RealSense cameras (e.g., D415 or D435).

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- ‚úÖ **Send joint trajectories** to the UR3e via `/scaled_joint_trajectory_controller`.
- ‚úÖ **Control Robotiq 2F-140** gripper via ROS 2 services.
- ‚úÖ **Open/Close gripper** via Python service clients.
- ‚úÖ **Integrate RealSense camera** for perception tasks.
-  Future support for MoveIt 2 and camera-based pick-and-place.
